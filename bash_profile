# Bash init file for interactive login shells,
# i.e. when bash is invoked with the `--login` flag.
#
# In practice, a login shell is created:
#
#   * when logging in to a linux console (without the GUI)
#   * when logging in over ssh
#   * running `su -`
#   * when most terminal emulators start a new session (window, tab, etc)
#   * when most terminal multiplexers (tmux, screen, etc) start a new session, pane, etc
#
# I don't (yet) have a use case for making a distinction between login
# and non-login interactive shells, so just do everything in bashrc.
